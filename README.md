> MsDacia's personal sandbox of projects

**Note:** This sandbox is setup to allow me to continue to teach myself current technologies. I am consistently trying to stay current, and my personal website works as a catalyst to experiment, make mistakes, and prove that I can do this. If you have any feedback, ideas, or suggestions, please comment and I will get back to you.

## My Plan
1. Learn UI and UX
2. ~~Create my own design~~
3. Do amore advance animations with CSS3
4. Learn React, Redux
5. ~~Learn Vue2~~
6. Learn Angular2 and TypeScript
7. Learn Firebase
8. Learn e2e and unit tests [WIP]
9. Maybe...and a strong maybe to learn a backend technology like Scala


### For Hire
I am currently looking for projects in VueJS, AngularJS, and CraftCMS/Twig. I always looking for SIDE projects to help showcase my skills.

**Note:** This sandbox is setup to allow me to continue to teach myself current technologies. I am consistently trying to stay current, and my personal website works as a catalyst to experiment, make mistakes, and prove that I can do this. If you have any feedback, ideas, or suggestions, please comment and I will get back to you.

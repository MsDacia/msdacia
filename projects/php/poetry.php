			<h1>Poetic Thoughts</h1>
			<p>My poetry was written under the influences of scarce inspiration. These words come from what was inside of me. My poetry is not to offend anyone, but to express how I perceive things. There are only a few poems here, but if you would like to read more, please email me at daciaj at yahoo dot com.  &mdash; MsDacia</p>

						<h2>GodGivenBeauty<sup>&copy;</sup> 4/11/99</h2>
						<span class="reference">Proverbs 31:10</span>

						<p>Golden brown woman<br />
						Soul so pure<br />
						Maneuvering in her own state of mind</p>

						<p>In a world so unsecure<br />
						Locked from root to end<br />
						Be careful not to fall into sin<br />
						Her body is her temple<br />
						Her past is her story<br />
						The touch of her fingers so gentle</p>

						<p>For GOD receives her glory<br />
						Silver being her choice of jewelry<br />
						For gold brings too much attention<br />
						Subtle is the key<br />
						A definite shape of her dimension<br />
						No sex, better known as celibacy</p>

						<p>On the right track,<br />
						Only the Word of GOD, the best orgasmic ecstasy<br />
						Duce plus five feet<br />
						A smile one could adore<br />
						Anointed with five piercings<br />
						Each moment better than before</p>

						<p>GodGivenBeauty being her name<br />
						For HE created this gift<br />
						Better known as Dacia,<br />
						Brought to life this beautiful myth</p>

						<h2>Sneaky Serpent<sup>&copy;</sup> 4/1/99</h2>
						<span class="reference">James 4:7 &amp; Ephesians 4:27</span>

						<p>Sneaky serpent<br />
						Always trying to get in my life<br />
						Causing drama and temptation<br />
						Trying to bow guard your way into my heart<br />
						Bring pain and temptation<br />
						You just don't know you are getting into</p>

						<p>Are you ready to handle this?<br />
						Something to make you think back and reminisce<br />
						No shots, no loses<br />
						Everything to gain<br />
						Stepping into the wrong field<br />
						End up left with no remains</p>

						<p>A challenge rarely conquered<br />
						Stand me ground like a solider<br />
						My self-esteem is strong as a boulder<br />
						Crawl under my rock<br />
						Get out of my sight<br />
						Flee like the punk you really are</p>

						<h2>Rejection<sup>&copy;</sup> 4/9/99</h2>
						<span class="reference">Hebrews 11:6</span>

						<p>Rejection is the name of the game<br />
						GodGivenBeauty is my name</p>

						<p>Done faced rejection with no shame<br />
						Flipped the script, releasing no pain<br />
						Some brush it off, some go insane<br />
						Some wanna fake it, but really can't hang<br />
						Rejecting garbage leaving no remains<br />
						Prioritizing my life, making all claims</p>

						<p>Pack your bags, it's time for change<br />
						On a natural high, on a higher plane</p>

						<p>Counting my blessings one by one<br />
						An assumption, no need to make one<br />
						Rejecting doing things that's already been done</p>

						<p>No time for petty confrontation<br />
						Setting up my goals, I'm on a mission<br />
						Conquering ground from every direction<br />
						Knocking over critics taking no rejection<br />
						The LORD reigns, due for a promotion<br />
						Rocking Adidas across the nation</p>

						<p>Dreadlocks growing, building a strong foundation<br />
						Standing strong, always in meditation<br />
						Yes or no, only demonic rejection<br />
						Pleasing in HIS eyes is the best and only condition<br />
						Nothing artificial, everything real</p>

						<p>Breaking the Word down to the real deal<br />
						Expressing my opinion, don't care how you feel<br />
						Don't fall into the stereotype of being normal<br />
						In this day and age, things get critical<br />
						Cracking up laughing like this is a commercial<br />
						Steering away from doing things traditional</p>

						<p>Making my covenant multi-generational<br />
						Prospering continually, both internal and external<br />
						Consecrating myself, refusing to be normal<br />
						Praising HIS name and spreading the gospel<br />
						Until Jesus come and I rest forever and eternal</p>

						<h2>The Effect He Has On Me<sup>&copy;</sup> 4/21/99</h2>
						<span class="reference">Isaiah 54:5</span>

						<p>The effect He has on me is so enticing<br />
						The web this spider creates leave me entangled in a love so mesmerizing<br />
						The honey this bee produces,</p>

						<p>Tasting it leaves my lips drunk like I am under the influences<br />
						The rain that makes the mud<br />
						Covers my skin, clothing my body like a glove<br />
						The sun that shines on the earth,<br />
						Warms me and soothes me like the moment right before birth<br />
						A smile shoots across my face,</p>

						<p>When I see HIS presence standing so tall and<br />
						Bold occupying just enough space<br />
						It's like the strength that He possess<br />
						Protects me from all drama life reflects<br />
						This warrior lays down the law<br />
						From dusk to dawn, HIS loving is continuously raw</p>

						<p>The story told in HIS eyes<br />
						&hellip;is so educating,<br />
						One can understand why He is so wise<br />
						See the vibes He sends off gets into my bones,<br />
						When He leaves my presence, I feel all alone<br />
						Yet, HIS spirit is always with me, swimming in my soul</p>

						<p>Comforting me, holding me, losing all control<br />
						Condoling my every doubt and fear<br />
						To not pursue HIM would be as useless<br />
						as a mute man screaming in a deaf man's ear<br />
						Seated at HIS throne, a king of mine<br />
						Placed as HIS earthly queen, this power is so divine</p>

						<h2>Untitled<sup>&copy;</sup> 4/13/99</h2>
						<span class="reference">1 Corinthians 5:7</span>

						<p>Things one day will never be the same the next<br />
						Too many things happen in life making things so complex</p>

						<p>To be able to live and cope with this reality<br />
						To not go insane, but to fight to maintain morality<br />
						Every person living in this earth<br />
						Needs to be commended for excelling yearly to another day of birth<br />
						Not by my will, and not by yours, but the will of the Heavenly Father<br />
						Praising HIS name and doing HIS will, life will extend even farther</p>
